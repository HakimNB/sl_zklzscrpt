At the end of the year, we will organize the group folders from the beginning of the day (2018/12/19). The specific measures are as follows.
◆All sharing materials before 2018/12/18(2) will be deleted from the group folder and moved to the Egnyte network disk. You can click the Egnyte link to browse. (link: https://igg.egnyte.com/fl/8MnHTlzfRQ; PW: 7unVq9wP)
◆All sharing materials after 2018/12/18(2) will still be uploaded to the group folder.
PS: If you are unable to access the Egnyte network disk in Taiwan or other branch offices, please provide [Real Name + EIP User Name] to the corresponding interface person.
◇Taiwan: Si Shunyu @PMO-司顺玮
◇Other branches: Lin Huiling@PMO-林惠玲
 
As of 2018/12/21 (five), we will summarize the list and ask the technical department to open the network disk. @all members
